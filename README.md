## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### 2️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebooks
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open and execute:
- `Inferential_stats.ipynb`
- `Logistic_regression.ipynb`
- `Predictive_Modelling.ipynb`

### 3️⃣ Run the Python Application
```bash
python main_stl.py
```

This will launch an interactive menu-driven program that allows you to:
- Add student habit data
- Remove existing entries
- View all records
- Get habit-based recommendations by performance category
